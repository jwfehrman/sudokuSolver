This directory contains the pre-trained MNIST model.

The model should be named 'mnist_lenet.zip' and should be placed in this directory.
You can download a pre-trained MNIST model from various sources or train your own using DL4J.

For now, the application will initialize with random weights if no pre-trained model is found.
